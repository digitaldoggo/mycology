### The Fruiting Block Recipe

#### For every 5 lb fruiting block:

- 5 cups of hardwood pellets  
- 1.4 liters water  
- 1 1/4 cups wheat bran

### Step 1: Measure Out the Components

This recipe will make a block weighing approximately **4 lb 4 oz**.  
After adding **12 oz of grain spawn**, your final block should weigh **5 lbs**.

It's best to make multiple blocks at a timeâ€”however many can fit in your pressure sterilizer.

> **Example**:  
> A *Presto pressure canner* can hold 4 large blocks. For that, use:  
> - 20 cups hardwood pellets  
> - 22.5 cups water  
> - 5 cups wheat bran

### Step 2: Add Water to Sawdust Pellets

1. Place your hardwood sawdust pellets in a large tote or container.
2. Add the measured water.
3. Mix until the pellets break down into a loose sawdust texture.  
   - **Tip**: Warm water helps break down pellets faster but isn't required.
4. Ensure all pellets are broken down thoroughly.

### Step 3: Add Wheat Bran

1. Add the measured wheat bran to the hydrated sawdust.
2. Mix thoroughly and evenly.
   - **Note**: You can increase the amount of bran for more nutrition, but this also raises the risk of contamination and may lead to diminishing returns.

### Step 4: Add Mixture to Grow Bags

1. Weigh out **4 lbs 4 oz** of the sawdust/bran mixture.
2. Place the mixture into a **mushroom grow bag**.
   - These bags are made of **polypropylene**, which withstands sterilization.
   - The **filter patch** allows for air exchange during colonization.
3. After adding **12 oz grain spawn**, the block will weigh **5 lbs**.
